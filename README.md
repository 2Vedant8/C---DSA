## Data Structures

🗂️ This section covers various data structures, each with its own unique characteristics and use cases. Dive into the folders to explore the implementations and understand how these structures work:

- [Array](/data-structures/array)
- [Linked List](/data-structures/linked-list)
- [Stack](/data-structures/stack)
- [Queue](/data-structures/queue)
- [Tree](/data-structures/tree)
- [Graph](/data-structures/graph)
- [Hash Table](/data-structures/hash-table)
- [Heap](/data-structures/heap)
- [...and more](/data-structures)

Feel free to explore each folder and discover the wonders of these data structures. 😄

## Algorithms

🔍 This section focuses on algorithms that solve common problems and challenges. Take a look at the available implementations and witness the power of efficient algorithms:

- [Sorting](/algorithms/sorting)
